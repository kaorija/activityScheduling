# activityScheduling
A Java program that implements the greedy algorithm for the Activity Scheduling problem. This program consists of a single Java class named ActivityScheduling.java, and is compilable with the simple command "javac ActivityScheduling.java". This program takes two command-line arguments: an input file and an output file. The first line of the input file will is an integer N, which represents the number of problem instances contained in the file. It is then followed by the N instance specifications. The first line of the specification of each instance is an integer M, that represents the size of the number of activities for that instance. It is then followed by M lines, where the i-th line contains two integers representing the start time and finish time for the i-th activity. The output file created by this program contains N lines, where the j-th line consists of a single number representing the solution (the maximum number of compatible activities) to the j-th instance in the input file.
